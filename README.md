Things I learned from this project: 

- having your ids match is super important; otherwise javascript and htmnl don't know what you are referencing. 
- how to have javascript dynamically render objects to the DOM by having empty divs on the HTML
- how to create one event listener for several filter buttons; allows for smoother code and no duplicate/redundant code
- Ensuring your renderToDom or cardsOnDom functions are in the appropriate places to allow the code to render appropriately  
-how to style card dynamically within javascript
